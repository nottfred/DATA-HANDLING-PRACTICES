DATA RISK ASSESSMENT

SCENERIO

Review the following scenerio. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You work for an educational technology company that developed an application to help teachers authomatically gradeassignments. The application handles a wide range of data that it collects from academics institutions,instructors,parents and students.

Your team was alerted to a data leak of internal business plans on social media. An investigation by the team discovered that an employee accidentally shared those confidential documents with an external business partner. An audit into the leak is underway to determine how similar incidents can be avoided.

A supervisor provided you with information regarding the leak. it appears that the principle of the least privildge was not observed by the employees at the company during a sales meeting. you have been asked to analyze the situation and find ways to prevent it from happening again.

Firstly, you will need to evaluate details about the incident. Then, you will review the controls in place to prevent data leaks. Next, you’ll identify ways to improve information privacy at the company. Finally, you’ll justify why you think your recommendations will make data handling at the company more secure. 

Step-By-Step Instructions
Analyze the situation
The principle of least priviledge is a fundamental security control that helps maintain information privacy, However, least priviledge starts to lose its effectiveness when too many users are given access to information. Data leaks commonly happen as information gets passed between people without oversight.

To start your analysis, review the following incident summary provided by your supervisor: 
A customer success representative received access to a folder of internal documents from a manager. it contained files associated with a new product offering, including customer analytics and marketing materials. The manager forgot to unshare the folder. Later, the representative copied a link to the marketing materials to share with a business partner during a sales call. Instead, the representative shared a link to the entire folder. During the sales call, the business partner received a link to internal documents and posted it to their social media page.

After reviewing the summary, write 20-60 words (2-3 sentences) in the issue(s) row of data leak worksheet describing the factors that led to the data leak.

Review current data privacy controls 
Data leaks are a major risk due to the amount of data handled by the application. The company used the NIST cybersecurity framework (CSF) to develop their plan for addressing their information privacy concerns.

Review the security plan snapshot resource of the worksheet. Then, review the NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 resource of the worksheet. 
After write 20-60 words (2-3 sentences) in the review row of the data leak worksheet to summarize what you’ve learned about NIST SP 800-53: AC -6 .

Identify control enhancement
The company’s implementation of least privildge is based on NIST special publication 800-53 (SP 800-53). NIST developed SP 800-53 to provide businesses with a customizable information privacy plan. it’s a comprehensive resource that describes a wide range of control categories, including least priviledge.

Use the NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 resource to determine two control enhancements that might have prevented the data leak. list the two improvements in the recommendation(s) row of the worksheet.

Justify your recommendations
At the end of your analysis, its time to communicate your findings to your supervisor. It’s important to justify your recommendations so that the supervisor can relay this information to other decision makers at the company.

Consider the issues you identified earlier, Then write 20-60 words (2-3 sentences) in the justification row describing why you think the control enhancement you recommend will reduce the likelihood of another data leak.


Be sure to include in your responce:
2-3 sentences analyzing the factors that led to the incident 
2-3 sentences summarizing NIST SP 800-53: AC-6
2 control enhancement recommendatiions to improve least priviledge
2-3 sentences justifying your recommendations
